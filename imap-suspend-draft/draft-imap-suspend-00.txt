Internet-Draft           IMAP SUSPEND Extension            November 2012


1.  Introduction

   [TODO: Reorganize this section.  Disconnected talk should probably go
   lower in section, after talk about activating extensions.]

   The original IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] protocol specification was primarily
   designed to be used by clients that remain connected to the IMAP
   server for extended periods of time.  Since that time, "disconnected"
   IMAP clients [RFC4549] have become increasingly popular and numerous,
   due to the rise in, for example, portable devices that do not
   maintain persistent connections to the remove server, or for which
   keeping an active connection is expensive (in terms of computing
   and/or power).

   In response to the rise of these disconnected clients, various IMAP
   extensions have been developed to assist in accessing the remote
   account.  [TODO: Links to LEMONDAE profile?  UIDPLUS?]  Some of these
   extensions, such as QRESYNC [RFC5162], require explicit action by the
   client in order to activate their features.

   Additionally, advanced IMAP features have been implemented as various
   extensions, many of which require proactive action by the client in
   order to activate their fetures.  [TODO: Links to LANGUAGE?  NOTIFY?]

   Finally, there is additional overhead when connecting to an IMAP
   server (e.g. entering authenticated state) because the client needs
   to do things like determine the capabilities of the remote server
   (CAPABILITY command [RFC3501]) and, if available, to obtain the
   namespace layout for the mailboxes (NAMESPACE command [RFC2342]).

   Therefore, a disconnected client still faces the (potentially
   substantial) overhead of needing to perform various initialization
   initialization tasks before the client can begin to do "useful" work
   from the perspective of the end user (e.g. listing mailboxes
   accessing messages).  For clients that are unable to maintain a
   persistent connection the server, many of the gains provided by the
   advanced IMAP extensions are offset by the overhead to enable and
   confgure them on every access.

   The SUSPEND extension provides a mechanism for a client to save the
   state of an existing session and then quickly re-establish this state
   in subsequent server accesses.

   An IMAP server that supports SUSPEND advertises this by including the
   word SUSPEND in its capability list.

Internet-Draft           IMAP SUSPEND Extension            November 2012


1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  IMAP Protocol Changes

2.1.  SUSPEND Command

   Arguments:  none

   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: BYE
               OPTIONAL untagged response: SUSPEND

   Result:     OK - logout completed
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

   This section defines a new SUSPEND command.

   To close the connection with the server, the LOGOUT command [RFC3501]
   is issued.  The SUSPEND command extends the LOGOUT command by
   indicating to the server that, in addition to closing the network
   connection, the client also requests that the current connection
   state be saved.

   If the current IMAP session state can be saved, an untagged SUSPEND
   response (see Section 2.3) MUST be issued.  If the server cannot save
   the current state, a SUSPEND response MUST NOT be issued.

   Like the LOGOUT command, a server MUST send a BYE untagged response
   before the (tagged) OK response, and then close the network
   connection.

2.2.  RESUME Command

   Arguments:  suspend token

   Responses:  no specific responses for this command

   Result:     OK - state successfully restored
               NO - error: state could not be restored
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

   This section defines a new RESUME command.

   This command is used when a client desires to restore the session

Internet-Draft           IMAP SUSPEND Extension            November 2012


   state represented by a token previously generated by the server.

   The RESUME command MUST only be issued in the IMAP authenticated
   state.  If the RESUME command is issued in either the not
   authenticated state or the selected state, a BAD tagged response MUST
   be sent. [todo: reasoning behind not allowing in not authenticated
   state: the suspend token could potentially include sensitive
   information and should only be sent after any security layer has been
   initiated; reasoning behind not allowing in selected state: certain
   state commands may requir this (e.g.  ENABLE QRESYNC), and a server
   may use some sort of "replay" system to restore the session state -
   these commands may fail pre-existing assertions in the code]).

   If the server can successfully restore the state indicated by the
   given token, it MUST issue an tagged OK response.  This restored
   session MUST be identical to the state at the time the SUSPEND
   command that issued the token was issued.  After a successful RESUME
   command, the connection MUST be in the authenticated state (i.e. no
   mailbox is selected).

   If the server can not restore the state, it MUST issue a tagged NO
   response.

2.3.  SUSPEND Response

   Contents:   suspend token

   The SUSPEND response occurs as a result of a SUSPEND command.  The
   suspend token is a server-specific representation of the current
   state in the IMAP session (with the exception of the currently
   selected mailbox).

   [todo: A suspend token MUST become invalid if either the NAMESPACE or
   CAPABILITY configuration of the server changes.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the suspend token contain a versioning
   mechanism that would cause the token to be unsuccessful in restoring
   state if the internal state storage mechanism in the server changes.
   However, interpretation of the contents or format of the suspend
   token is left entirely to the server implementor.


3.  Implementation Considerations

3.1.  Client

   [todo: Successfully resuming a session guarantees that the NAMESPACE
   and CAPABILITY values of the server have not changed.  A client is

   RECOMMENDED to cache these values locally.  Not sure if this is even
   needed, since it is a/the main reason to use this extension.]

3.2.  Server

   [todo: If a client successfully resumes the session, the client
   SHOULD use its cached CAPABILITY value to determine the server's
   capabilities.  Therefore, sending CAPABILITY information after the
   client is authenticated is a waste of bandwidth and processing power.
   Several servers automatically issue an untagged CAPABILITY response
   after a client enters the authenticated state.  If the SUSPEND
   extension is implemented, a server SHOULD NOT automatically issue
   this data.]


4.  Examples

   Example 1: A client connects to a server and does not have a prior
   saved suspend token.  The client verifies that the server supports
   the SUSPEND extension, performs its initialization, and obtains a
   suspend token.  This example assumes that the client has successfully
   completed authorization to the IMAP server.

            C: A1 CAPABILITY
            S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 ENABLE QRESYNC I18NLEVEL=1 SUSPEND
            S: A1 OK Capability command completed.
            C: A2 ENABLE QRESYNC
            S: * ENABLED QRESYNC
            S: A2 OK Enable command completed.
            C: A3 LANGUAGE DE
            S: * LANGUAGE (DE)
            S: * NAMESPACE (("" "/")) (("Other Users/" "/"
                 "TRANSLATION" ("Andere Ben&APw-tzer/")))
                 (("Public Folders/" "/" "TRANSLATION"
                 ("Gemeinsame Postf&AM8-cher/")))
            S: A3 Sprachwechsel durch LANGUAGE-Befehl ausgefuehrt
            [...]
            C: A20 SUSPEND
            S: * SUSPEND c3RhdGUgdG9rZW4=
            S: * BYE Server logging out.
            S: A20 OK Logout completed and session saved.

   Example 2: The client in Example 1 connects at a future time to the
   same server and seeks to restore the previous IMAP session.  This
   example assumes that the client has successfully completed
   authorization to the IMAP server.

             C: A1 RESUME c3RhdGUgdG9rZW4=

5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234].  Terms not defined here are
   taken from [RFC3501].

   capability =/  "SUSPEND"

   command-auth =/  resume / suspend

   response-data =/  "*" SP suspend-response CRLF

   resume =  "RESUME" SP suspend-token

   suspend =  "SUSPEND"

   suspend-response =  "SUSPEND" SP suspend-token

   suspend-token =  atom

   [todo: Token restricted to atom to reduce complexity]


6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add SUSPEND to the "IMAP 4 Capabilities"
   registry, http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities.


7.  Acknowledgements


8.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this extension doesn't add any security
   considerations that are not already present in the base IMAP protocol
   [RFC3501].
